    "text": "3.2 Determing the Appropriate Clusters\nData on interstate vehicle trips provides valuable insights into where visitors are coming from, often correlating with the proximity of national parks to population centers or major transportation hubs. Clustering can help account for regional tourism dynamics by grouping parks with similar visitor flows. Additionally, state-level outdoor recreation data, particularly concerning accommodation and food services, offers a broader understanding of trends, preferences, and activity levels that influence park visitation. States with a strong outdoor recreation culture may significantly contribute to national park visitation, making this data crucial for clustering. By incorporating recreation visitation data for each national park, I use four key indicators for further clustering analysis.\nThe Elbow Method and kneed package determine the “knee” point quantitatively, indicating four as the number of clusters.\n\n\narray([[ 2.7357308 ,  2.60922961, -0.66826553,  8.42932276],\n       [-0.18186611, -0.24451187,  0.1986735 ,  7.44326458],\n       [-0.25642049, -0.44099326,  2.23318497,  4.70917628],\n       [ 1.67750921,  2.37560822, -0.12378567,  4.454676  ],\n       [-0.83774033, -0.70868014,  0.67681032,  4.34827958]])\n\n\n\n\nc:\\Users\\19397\\.conda\\envs\\musa-550-fall-2023\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\cluster\\_kmeans.py:1436: UserWarning: KMeans is known to have a memory leak on Windows with MKL, when there are less chunks than available threads.

NPS lands are distributed across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Western states, like California, Alaska, and Utah, often host the largest expanses of NPS land due to their size and natural diversity. Eastern states tend to feature smaller, historically focused NPS sites. States with vast wilderness areas, such as Alaska, have a significant share of NPS lands. Smaller or more urbanized states often have fewer or smaller NPS sites but may house historically critical or highly visited landmarks.",

These differences suggest that these factors can provide meaningful insights when grouping states for further analysis.\nTotal Outdoor Recreation Value Added: This visualization shows outdoor recreation value added (in thousands of dollars), with values ranging from 0 to 80 million. California and Texas stand out with the darkest blue shades, suggesting they lead in outdoor recreation value added. Florida also shows a dark blue color, while most other states display much lighter shades, indicating lower outdoor recreation economic impact.\nAccommodation and Food Services Value Added: This map displays a different pattern, with values ranging from 0 to 10 million. The most striking feature is the dark blue coloring in California and Florida, along with a moderately dark shade in Texas. These three states appear to generate the highest value added from accommodation and food services. Most other states show much lighter shades, indicating lower values in this category.\nVehicle Trips: This map shows tourism-related vehicle trips across US states, with values ranging from 0 to 400 million. The darkest blue coloring appears in the northeastern states, particularly New York, indicating this region has the highest number of vehicle trips. There’s a gradual decrease in intensity moving westward, with most western states showing lighter blue shades, suggesting lower vehicle trip numbers.\nVehicle trips are concentrated in the Northeast, while accommodation services and outdoor recreation value are highest in California, Texas, and Florida. The distribution of vehicle trips shows a more gradual east-to-west gradient, whereas the other two indicators display more concentrated “hotspots” in specific states, emphasizing regional variations in outdoor recreation trends.",
